================
To enhance your existing AI content generation system with machine learning (ML) capabilities and workflow optimizations, here's a step-by-step approach for implementing the primary objectives outlined in your requirements. Below is a breakdown of the main tasks and how they can be approached programmatically.
Step 1: Setting Up the Environment

You'll need to install several libraries for machine learning, natural language processing, API integrations, and workflow automation.

pip install openai spacy tensorflow torch transformers clickup-sdk make-api pandas numpy matplotlib

Step 2: Integrating Machine Learning for Quality Prediction & Error Detection

The first goal is to build machine learning models that can predict the quality of content and detect errors. This includes detecting missing citations, topic drift, and incomplete sections.
2.1 Quality Prediction & Error Detection with NLP

You can train a model that predicts the quality score for content. For detecting missing citations or topic drift, natural language processing (NLP) models can be used.

import spacy
from transformers import pipeline
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load NLP model for topic drift detection (BERT for contextual analysis)
nlp_model = pipeline("zero-shot-classification")

# Function for detecting topic drift by comparing the current content with the outline
def detect_topic_drift(content, outline):
    candidate_labels = outline.split()  # Use key points from the outline as candidates
    result = nlp_model(content, candidate_labels)
    return result['labels'][0], result['scores'][0]  # Return the most likely label and score

# Function to detect missing citations using a citation database API or NLP matching
def detect_missing_citations(content, citation_database):
    # Simple approach to check for references (in practice, use a more sophisticated NLP approach)
    citations_found = [ref for ref in citation_database if ref in content]
    missing_citations = [ref for ref in citation_database if ref not in citations_found]
    return missing_citations

# Sample content and outline
content = "The study of AI in education has grown in recent years..."
outline = "AI, education, growth in AI technology"

# Detect topic drift
topic, score = detect_topic_drift(content, outline)
print(f"Topic Drift Detected: {topic} with a score of {score}")

# Example citation check (this would require a real citation database or API in practice)
citation_database = ["Smith et al. 2020", "Jones 2021"]
missing_citations = detect_missing_citations(content, citation_database)
print(f"Missing Citations: {missing_citations}")

Step 3: Workflow Automation Using ClickUp API and Make.com
3.1 Integrating with ClickUp API

You can use the ClickUp API to automate task management, track content versions, and trigger workflow events.

import requests

CLICKUP_API_KEY = "your_clickup_api_key"
CLICKUP_TEAM_ID = "your_team_id"
CLICKUP_LIST_ID = "your_list_id"

# Function to create a task in ClickUp
def create_clickup_task(task_name, description):
    url = f'https://api.clickup.com/api/v2/list/{CLICKUP_LIST_ID}/task'
    headers = {
        "Authorization": CLICKUP_API_KEY,
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    data = {
        "name": task_name,
        "description": description,
        "status": "open"
    }
    response = requests.post(url, json=data, headers=headers)
    return response.json()

# Create a new task for content generation
task_name = "Generate Academic Content for Article"
description = "Generate content about AI in education with citations and an outline."
task_response = create_clickup_task(task_name, description)
print(f"Created task: {task_response}")

3.2 Automating Workflow with Make.com

To automate workflows with Make.com (formerly Integromat), you can trigger actions in your AI system based on ClickUp task updates or other events. Here's a Python function to trigger an action on Make.com:

import requests

MAKE_API_URL = "https://hook.integromat.com/your_webhook_url"

# Function to trigger Make.com scenario based on ClickUp task update
def trigger_make_workflow(task_data):
    response = requests.post(MAKE_API

URL, json=task_data)
    return response.json()

# Example task data for triggering the workflow
task_data = {
    "task_id": "task_123456",
    "task_name": "Generate Academic Content for Article",
    "status": "open",
    "assigned_to": "user_id_789",
    "due_date": "2024-12-01"
}

# Trigger Make.com workflow
make_response = trigger_make_workflow(task_data)
print(f"Triggered Make.com workflow: {make_response}")

Step 4: Token Optimization and Context Window Management

For token optimization, you'll need to implement logic that keeps track of the token usage within the content generation system and optimize based on the model's constraints.

from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer

# Initialize GPT-2 tokenizer (you can replace this with your model's tokenizer)
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')

# Function to calculate token usage
def calculate_token_usage(content):
    tokens = tokenizer.encode(content)
    return len(tokens)

# Function to monitor and optimize token usage
def optimize_tokens(content, max_tokens=1024):
    token_count = calculate_token_usage(content)
    if token_count > max_tokens:
        # Truncate content to fit within token limit
        optimized_content = tokenizer.decode(tokenizer.encode(content)[:max_tokens])
        return optimized_content, token_count
    return content, token_count

# Example content with excessive token usage
content = "This is a long academic content example..." * 100

# Optimize content for token usage
optimized_content, token_count = optimize_tokens(content)
print(f"Original token count: {token_count}, Optimized content length: {len(optimized_content)}")

Step 5: Implementing the Full System

Now that we have created functions for quality prediction, error detection, workflow automation, and token optimization, you can integrate these modules into your existing content generation system.

Here’s an outline of the entire pipeline:

    Content Generation: The user inputs a topic, and the AI generates content using integrated APIs like GPT, BERT, or custom models.
    Content Quality Control: The system analyzes the content for missing citations, topic drift, incomplete sections, etc., using machine learning and NLP techniques.
    Workflow Management: Tasks are created in ClickUp for each content generation, and workflow automations are triggered using Make.com.
    Token Optimization: Before sending content to the AI model, token usage is optimized, ensuring it fits within the model's limits.
    Task Tracking and Notifications: The system monitors task progress and notifies users about completion, revisions, and quality scores.

Step 6: UI/UX Enhancements

For a seamless user experience, integrating UI elements like dashboards for monitoring task statuses, quality scores, and resource usage can significantly improve the workflow.

For example, you could create a Streamlit app to display the progress of content generation:

import streamlit as st

# Streamlit interface for monitoring content quality and workflow
st.title("AI Content Generation System")
st.write("Monitor your tasks and the quality of generated content.")

# Display task status
task_status = st.selectbox("Select Task Status", ["Open", "In Progress", "Completed"])

# Display task progress
st.progress(50)  # Example for task progress bar

# Display quality scores
quality_score = st.slider("Quality Score", 0, 100, 80)
st.write(f"Content Quality Score: {quality_score}%")

# Optimize tokens for large content
large_content = "This is some very large content..." * 100
optimized_content, token_count = optimize_tokens(large_content)

st.write(f"Optimized Content Length: {len(optimized_content)} tokens (original: {token_count})")

Step 7: Final Deliverables

    Machine Learning Models: Implement models for quality prediction, error detection, and task complexity prediction.
    Automated Content Cleanup: Implement scripts for cleaning and standardizing content.
    Workflow Automation: Seamless integration between ClickUp and your content generation system using Make.com.
    Context Window Management: Monitor and optimize token usage to avoid model limitations.
    Reference Validation: Use APIs or NLP techniques to ensure citation accuracy and consistency.
    UI/UX Enhancements: Create intuitive interfaces for task management, progress tracking, and content quality scores.

Conclusion

This approach enhances your AI content generation system by integrating machine learning for quality control, automating workflows, optimizing token usage, and ensuring that the content generated adheres to academic standards. The provided code snippets and integration steps will help streamline your system and meet the operational and performance targets you’ve outlined.
